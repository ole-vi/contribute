## Open Learning Exchange

Open Learning Exchange is a social benefit organization who is the main contributor of [open-learning-exchange](http://github.com/open-learning-exchange/) open source project where we built systems and infrastructure for running a fully federated and offline-first learning community. Think it is like a CDN for learning resource.

We always looking for talent to contribute to us. We have virtual volunteer and virtual software engineering internship which always open. Here are some of the openings.

* Software Engineering Intern - As a software engineering intern, you help us (OLE & community we serve) develop software for learning management system. The main project is [open-learning-exchange/planet](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/planet/) where we develop learning management system with Angular and CouchDB.

* Mobile Engineering Intern - As a mobile engineering intern, you help us develop mobile solution for systems and infrastructures we run. The two main projects are [treehouses/remote](https://github.com/treehouses/remote) and [open-learning-exchange/take-home](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/take-home). Remote help us to control Raspberry Pi device to deploy our application on Raspberry Pi running Docker container. Take Home is the mobile version of Planet, where we can save learning resource in Planet as something we can open offline in Tablet PC of any Android device.

## Treehouses

While Open Learning Exchange open source project deal with software development side of the project, the [treehouses](https://github.com/treehouses/) is the systems and infrastructure development of the project. Here play much with Raspberry Pi, Linux Scripting, Docker, Docker Swarm, and many other systems-related project.
